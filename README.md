# ImageProcessing
The goal of this project is to read a color image using the library OpenCV on python.
Apply the different techniques of image processing such as filtring by masks, segmentations, 
edge detection, in order to get the best interpretation result in the image pixel. 

Why filtring an image : 
The filters are used to add or remove noises from images

Why segmentation : 
Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments by grouping together pixel regions with some predefined characteristics. 
Each of the pixels in a region is similar with respect to some property, such as color, intensity, location, or texture. 
It is one of the most important image processing tools because it helps us to extract the objects from the image for further analysis. 
Moreover, the accuracy of the segmentation step determines success and failure in further image analysis.

Why contour detection : 
This method allows us to detect the contour of objects in the image, edge, boundaries by using filters (convolution filter)
